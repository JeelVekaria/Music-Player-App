This project involves making an audio content management system, similar to Spotify or Apple Music, by implementing features such as search functionalities based on title, artist, and genre, modifying the download action to support ranges and artist-specific or genre-specific downloads, incorporating exception handling using custom exception classes, and implementing file I/O to read audio content information from a file. Additionally, the project includes the use of maps for efficient search capabilities.
